In this folter you can find my task for the week 7.

In order to generate HTTP request, i used the libreary called Flask.

On my code, you can find 4 requests (2 GET, 1 POST, 1 Delate).

During the realisation of this task, i also learn how to capture data from another web site.

I order to do that, i used the function called request.get()
